In college I went to the Dominican Republic on a two week immersion trip.
I spent nearly a week living in a farming village in the mountains of the DR.
I learned about their culture, and the struggles they faced as farmers, along with how intelligent, hardworking, and good natured they were.
We then spent some time in a Haitian refugee camp, learning about the conditions that people who were forced out of their own country and not welcomed by any other face.
